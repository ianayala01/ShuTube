Good boy. Come on. Turn.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.553
Hold, son. Hold, son.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.772
Come on, son. That's it.

01:45.855 --> 01:46.981
Turn, turn.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.734
Come on. Come on, son.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.528
Come on.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.255
-Buenos días.
-Buenos días.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.091
How did you sleep?

02:13.883 --> 02:15.218
-Pretty good.
-Mm.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.721
I didn't see Gabri's car.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.182
She called. She's fine, John.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.226
She's at Antonia's.

02:23.309 --> 02:27.355
I was hoping she'd help me ride
that new bald-faced stallion.

02:27.438 --> 02:30.859
She'd like that horse.
He turns great. Great turner.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.446
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.323
You know, she'd be a good trainer.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.659
She's got a way with horses.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.994
Don't you think?

02:41.077 --> 02:42.245
Mm, maybe.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.540
But she is going to college.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.585
You think she wants to smell like horses
all the time like you?

02:48.668 --> 02:51.379
[chuckles] That bad?

02:51.462 --> 02:54.424
No, para nada, if you like horses.

-[girl] Uncle John!
-In here!

04:03.785 --> 04:05.578
Hey.

04:05.662 --> 04:06.704
Afternoon.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.832
Did you finish working out the horses?

04:10.541 --> 04:11.918
Yeah, pretty much.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.964
[sizzling]

04:16.047 --> 04:17.298
What you working on?

04:20.468 --> 04:22.053
You know what this is?

04:22.804 --> 04:23.930
A small knife.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.015
No, it's Damascus steel.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.269
It's a letter opener I made
for when you go away to college.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.646
And I'm gonna add on these white handles.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.731
Letter opener?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.692
It'd be beautiful on your desk.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.986
Oh.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.823
Uh, I hate to break it to you,
but nobody writes letters anymore.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.491
Hmm.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.078
Well, then you can use it
to keep the boys away.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.956
-Anyway.
-Okay.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.166
[horse whinnies]

04:52.250 --> 04:55.003
[Gabrielle] It's crazy.
I'm about to start college.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.714
I don't know why. I have no idea
what I want to do yet.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.050
Did you know what you
wanted to do at my age?

05:02.844 --> 05:04.595
[Rambo] Yeah, I wanted to be a soldier.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.347
[Gabrielle] At my age?

05:06.431 --> 05:07.974
Even before your age.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.227
Did you like it?

05:11.311 --> 05:14.731
Well, I had some of the best friends
I ever had for a while.

05:16.816 --> 05:21.404
It's gonna be real quiet around here
without you asking all these questions.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.739
[chuckles]

05:22.822 --> 05:24.741
-I'm sure you'll survive.
-Yeah.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.538
The sun's setting. I only have about
an hour left to ride, okay?

05:30.621 --> 05:33.833
-Why is that?
-I have to go to Antonia's.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.420
She's throwing this thing for the guys
who are going to college in the fall.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.132
Why don't you invite them here?

05:41.215 --> 05:42.300
What?

05:42.383 --> 05:43.676
Bring them over here.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.846
Remember what happened last time?

05:46.929 --> 05:48.973
-You freaked them out.
-Why?

05:49.057 --> 05:50.850
Because you wouldn't stop staring at them.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.727
Oh, no.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.521
Yeah, I do that sometimes,
but it's not intentional.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.816
Thank you, but Antonia's got it covered.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.777
We're just gonna have it there, okay?

06:03.446 --> 06:04.822
Show them the tunnels.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.200
What?

06:07.283 --> 06:08.951
Show them the tunnels.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.579
You don't let anybody go in the tunnels.

06:11.662 --> 06:15.083
No, but they're your friends,

06:15.166 --> 06:16.292
so they're welcome.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.670
-Okay, cool. Yeah.
-Yeah, show them the tunnels.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.298
-Yeah, that would be fun.
-Yeah.

06:22.381 --> 06:25.301
Hey, I'm really gonna miss
riding with you.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.969
[chuckles]

06:27.053 --> 06:28.930
I'm gonna miss riding with you too.

[hip-hop music on speakers]

06:34.310 --> 06:36.062
[chattering]

06:37.271 --> 06:38.481
Get ready.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.816
[boy] Whoa!

06:41.317 --> 06:43.986
Isn't this cool? He's never let
anyone down here.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.696
[boy] This is crazy, man.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.950
[in Spanish] That music is horrible.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.036
If her mom could hear it…
Do you like that music?

06:52.537 --> 06:54.038
[in English] I could get used to it.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.376
-I hope she's having a good time.
-Hmm.

06:58.459 --> 07:01.129
You never let me in the tunnels. Hmm?

07:03.214 --> 07:05.967
If you really wanna go in,
I'll take you on a guided tour.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.469
No, thank you. Too dirty.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.555
It is that. [chuckles]

[music continues]

07:15.518 --> 07:16.894
[sighs]

07:25.361 --> 07:27.572
[boy] This is a great place
for a party, baby.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.949
Not right now, okay?
I have a lot on my mind.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.242
No, I understand.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.829
-Did you draw that?
-Yeah.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.539
I drew that, actually,
when I was ten years old.

07:36.622 --> 07:37.957
That's a masterpiece.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.750
-[cell phone vibrating]
-Who's that?

07:41.586 --> 07:44.589
I gotta take this. Gizelle?

07:44.672 --> 07:47.383
[Gizelle] Hey, girl, can you hear me?
The reception is not so good.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.676
No, no. Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.262
Tell me everything.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.021
-Gabrielle?
-Yeah?

08:00.104 --> 08:02.648
[bottles clinking]

08:02.732 --> 08:05.610
What are you doing down here?
All of your friends have left.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.987
They made a big mess.
I'm just cleaning up.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.698
So, how did it go?

08:10.781 --> 08:13.534
Um, everyone had a good time.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.621
They kept asking me why my uncle
built these tunnels.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.289
What did you say?

08:19.415 --> 08:23.044
I said that you like digging
and you're a little crazy.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.545
That's fair enough.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.384
I need to talk to you about something.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.095
And I just want you to have
an open mind about it.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.891
I need to go to Mexico.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.769
Why would you want to do that?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.939
Because I found my father.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.027
My friend Gizelle, who lives there--

08:48.110 --> 08:50.863
Well, she used to live here.
Do you remember her?

08:51.864 --> 08:53.491
Mm-hmm.

08:53.574 --> 08:57.703
I asked her for a favor,
and she found him.

08:59.413 --> 09:01.332
He lives in a town near hers.

09:04.210 --> 09:08.881
Uncle John, I have to do this.
I need to hear it from him.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.635
I need to understand
why he would just do that.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.304
Because he's not a good man.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.974
-Can't be that simple.
-It is.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.893
Uncle John, I've heard the stories. I know
you've been through a lot.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.855
But my world is
a lot different from yours.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.107
No, it's not. It's worse.

09:26.190 --> 09:28.025
No, it's not.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.486
People don't just act bad for no reason.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.823
There's no reason for a man to throw his
family away. He's lucky he has one.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.492
-Why are you getting so mad?
-Because you don't know how bad it is.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.536
I know how black a man's heart can be.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.788
There's nothing good out there, Gabrielle.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.748
-Maybe he's changed.
-Men like that don't change.

09:42.832 --> 09:43.666
It only gets worse.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.042
You changed.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.587
I haven't changed.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.755
I'm just trying to
keep a lid on it, every day.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.966
Uncle John, I need you to trust me.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.177
I need you to know that
I'm gonna make good decisions.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.391
I can't control what's out there.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.685
You can't just protect me forever.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.146
As long as I'm around,

10:05.229 --> 10:07.023
he's never gonna hurt you again.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.359
No one is.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.821
You said you did
what you thought was right and left at 17,

10:13.904 --> 10:15.531
and nobody stopped you.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.075
I wish they had.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.872
Gabrielle, I care for you like a daughter.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.167
I know you want answers.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.044
Just wait a little while.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.338
Grow up a little bit.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.758
Know about the world a little bit.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.845
Would you do that for me, please?

10:41.641 --> 10:42.850
All right.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.188
Thanks.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.815
-I'm gonna go to bed.
-Good night.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.193
Good night.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.456
[Maria shouting indistinctly in Spanish]

11:12.588 --> 11:15.299
[in Spanish] He never wanted
you around him!

11:15.383 --> 11:16.258
[in English] I just wanna know why.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.343
[in Spanish] Who cares why?

11:17.426 --> 11:20.721
The man is dead inside!
He has no heart, no soul…

11:20.805 --> 11:22.306
[in English] What's going on?

11:22.390 --> 11:23.849
[in English] She wants to see her father.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.023
Gabrielle, I thought
we had an understanding.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.318
We did. We did. I'm sorry.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.862
But I've been thinking
about it all night, and…

11:37.988 --> 11:40.074
I just want answers now, not later.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.534
How did you find him?

11:44.578 --> 11:45.871
Gizelle helped me.

11:45.955 --> 11:46.997
Gizelle.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.374
[in Spanish] She still talks to Gizelle.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.500
[in English] Yeah.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.043
[In Spanish] Gizelle is a bad girl.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.045
-[in Spanish] She's changed.
-[in Spanish] No! She hasn't changed!

11:53.129 --> 11:55.297
I was very happy when she left.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.715
[in English] Grandma, she's just trying
to help me.

11:56.799 --> 12:01.679
[in Spanish] He won't even remember you!
He never behaved like a father.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.681
[in English] That man is more your father.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.058
Watching over you, protecting you.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.853
These last ten years, he was the father.
[speaks Spanish]

12:08.936 --> 12:09.895
Maria, go easy.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.147
No. Why?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.023
Because.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.194
[in Spanish] He doesn't deserve
to lay eyes on you!

12:17.278 --> 12:20.823
He never once went to the hospital
when your mother was dying of cancer.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.617
One Christmas, John had to pull
him off your mother

12:23.701 --> 12:25.411
when he was beating her with a belt!

12:25.494 --> 12:26.537
[in English] That's enough.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.663
[in English] Tell her.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.333
[in Spanish] I don't want you
around that man!

33:32.427 --> 33:37.140
Just do the fucking job,

33:37.265 --> 33:40.101
If it's forty, fifty men, too bad…

33:40.476 --> 33:43.479
You don't stop until you're told to.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.606

33:56.075 --> 33:57.785
[man panting]

33:58.369 --> 34:01.706

38:05.574 --> 38:06.909
Get him up.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.583
[softly, in English] Let her go.

38:14.667 --> 38:15.751
[in English] What?

38:17.670 --> 38:19.046
Let her--

38:19.130 --> 38:21.549
-Let her go.
-[boss] Let her go.

38:21.632 --> 38:24.343

38:37.940 --> 38:39.317
Juanito Rambo.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.277
[laughs]

38:42.236 --> 38:44.613
[in English] Wanna know something,
Juanito?

38:44.697 --> 38:47.658
These girls mean nothing to me
or my customers.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.746
In my world, they're nothing.
They're not people.

38:51.829 --> 38:54.999
They're just-- They're just things.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.419
They have no worth to men like us.

38:59.795 --> 39:03.549
So I would have not
paid attention to this…

39:05.426 --> 39:06.469
to her.

39:06.552 --> 39:07.511
[Rambo groans]

39:07.595 --> 39:09.889
But now I will.

39:09.972 --> 39:14.393
Because you coming here
has made it very bad for her, cabrón.

39:14.477 --> 39:18.481
We would've just trained her,
used her and sold her.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.942
But now we're gonna make
an example of her.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.696
I'm gonna let you live.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.074
[in Spanish]
What the hell are you saying?

39:28.157 --> 39:29.992
[in Spanish] I am talking Victor! Fuck!

39:33.704 --> 39:36.665
[in English] You're gonna think about this
every fucking day of your fucking life.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.671
Until you can't think anymore, Juanito.

39:48.427 --> 39:49.845
[Rambo grunts]

39:49.929 --> 39:53.557
[in Spanish] Put your mark on him
and his little bitch, too.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.812
And make it deep. Make it deep.

40:06.028 --> 40:07.363

40:32.388 --> 40:33.806
[woman mumbling in Spanish]

40:36.559 --> 40:37.518

Let me help you. Can you stand?

40:42.565 --> 40:44.984
[both grunting]

40:49.113 --> 40:51.657
Okay, you have to get up.
They will come back.

41:01.625 --> 41:02.793
Let her go.

41:04.336 --> 41:05.463
Let her go.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.637
No, no, no!

41:44.376 --> 41:45.753
[in Spanish] Who's this?

41:48.589 --> 41:51.091
[in Spanish] Who is this guy?

41:52.593 --> 41:54.261
[in Spanish] Where did you get that?

41:59.350 --> 42:01.810
-[Gabrielle] No, no, no.
-Who is he?

42:01.894 --> 42:03.979
[whimpering, panting]

42:05.272 --> 42:07.525
It doesn't matter now.

42:07.608 --> 42:08.901
[Gabrielle whimpers]

42:08.984 --> 42:10.819
He's lying on the street…

42:12.488 --> 42:14.532
with my mark on his face.

42:16.784 --> 42:19.286
[speaks Spanish, echoing]

42:19.370 --> 42:20.996
[Gabrielle] No, no, no.

42:22.331 --> 42:24.750

42:33.968 --> 42:35.344
No, no, no.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.347
[screams]

42:47.731 --> 42:50.776
[in Spanish] If he stays still,
these should hold.

42:50.859 --> 42:54.446
He has a serious concussion and
should be in the hospital.

42:55.739 --> 42:56.740
[in Spanish] I know.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.367
Fine.

43:01.870 --> 43:08.877
Because of the concussion, he'll have
sensitivity to noise, to light.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.090
He should be better in a couple of days.

43:13.882 --> 43:18.387
Carmen, you know I care about you,
but this is crazy.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.222
Don't worry.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.600
Yeah. Goodbye.

43:30.190 --> 43:32.735

[Rambo groans]

44:11.607 --> 44:14.193

44:27.790 --> 44:28.916
[in English] You're up.

44:30.167 --> 44:31.168
Yeah.

44:33.045 --> 44:34.213
Are you okay?

44:35.422 --> 44:36.674
Who are you?

44:37.925 --> 44:39.093
Carmen Delgado.

44:40.135 --> 44:41.470
What is your name?

44:41.929 --> 44:43.013
John.

44:44.848 --> 44:47.518
Your truck is in the garage, by the way.

44:49.978 --> 44:51.188
How did I get here?

44:53.065 --> 44:54.400
I brought you here.

44:54.483 --> 44:56.402
You don't even know me.

44:56.485 --> 44:58.445
Why do I have to know you?

44:59.196 --> 45:00.531
Um…

45:00.614 --> 45:02.699
You were in trouble.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.701
I don't know, I would do it for anyone.

45:05.619 --> 45:07.371
Why were you even there?

45:08.455 --> 45:10.374
I'm an independent journalist.

45:11.458 --> 45:13.460
I was following El Flaco…

45:15.587 --> 45:18.132
a pimp who drugs and sells girls.

45:19.425 --> 45:22.219
I saw you in the club, watching him.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.973
I saw what you did to him.

45:26.056 --> 45:27.766
How long have I been here?

45:28.684 --> 45:30.477
-Four days.
-Four days?

45:30.561 --> 45:31.728
Mm-hmm.

45:31.812 --> 45:32.896
Christ.

45:34.189 --> 45:35.441
You gotta tell me…

45:37.109 --> 45:38.610
Where are the men that took her?

45:38.694 --> 45:40.904
Who did they take? Your daughter?

45:40.988 --> 45:42.948
Yeah. Where is she?

45:43.031 --> 45:44.491
Who are they?

45:46.118 --> 45:47.411
The Martínez brothers.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.247
They took my sister.

45:52.166 --> 45:55.544
They found her dead from an overdose
three years ago.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.380
I'm sorry.

45:59.423 --> 46:03.260
You just gotta tell me
where you think they are.

46:03.343 --> 46:05.012
No, it doesn't work this way.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.222
There's too many of them.

46:07.306 --> 46:08.765
Are you crazy or what?

46:08.849 --> 46:11.185
I'm not thinking about that.

46:11.268 --> 46:12.936
All I can think about is…

46:14.438 --> 46:16.440
how scared she must be,

46:17.024 --> 46:18.609
what she's going through,

46:19.735 --> 46:21.612
and what your sister went through.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.866
Just help me, please.

46:25.949 --> 46:27.910
I can't do it without you.

46:32.789 --> 46:34.291
-Okay.
-Thank you.

46:35.709 --> 46:36.710
Thanks.

47:24.132 --> 47:25.092
[bouncer, in Spanish]
What do you want?

47:25.175 --> 47:26.218

47:26.301 --> 47:28.136

-Gabrielle. Come here.
-[Gabrielle] No!

48:31.533 --> 48:33.493
-No, Gabrielle! Gabrielle.
-No!

48:33.577 --> 48:35.287
It's John.

48:35.370 --> 48:37.456
-It's Uncle John.
-[Gabrielle sobbing]

48:37.539 --> 48:39.166
It's all right. It's all right.

48:39.249 --> 48:41.001
It's your uncle. It's your uncle.

48:41.084 --> 48:43.962
[whimpering, gasping]

49:02.105 --> 49:04.483
Okay. We're going home.

49:04.566 --> 49:06.360
You're going home. You're safe now.

49:31.093 --> 49:34.012
[Vito, in Spanish] So no one saw anything?

49:34.805 --> 49:37.808
-I told you to kill that fucker!
-That's enough, Vito.

49:37.891 --> 49:39.017
It was him!

49:39.101 --> 49:42.688
Only an old fuck would come back
for some cut-up bitch.

49:42.771 --> 49:44.314
We'll find him and kill him.

49:44.398 --> 49:46.149
No, no, no, no, no.

49:46.233 --> 49:48.402
I don't give a fuck about him!

49:48.485 --> 49:49.986
This is your mess.

49:50.070 --> 49:51.780
What the hell do you want?

49:54.074 --> 49:57.994
Next time, do what I tell you, bro.

50:00.706 --> 50:01.707
Let's go!

[shouts] Back to work!

50:13.510 --> 50:15.971
[Gabrielle breathing raggedly]

50:30.402 --> 50:31.695
You came back.

50:34.030 --> 50:36.992
We're gonna get you back,
get you back home.

50:42.164 --> 50:45.083
-I'm sorry.
-No.

50:45.167 --> 50:48.545
You didn't do anything.
You didn't do anything at all.

50:48.628 --> 50:51.047
We're gonna go home, and everything's
gonna be good.

50:51.131 --> 50:52.549
It's gonna be all right.

50:56.595 --> 50:57.637
Okay.

50:59.181 --> 51:00.891
I got this back for you.

51:12.986 --> 51:15.363
Gabrielle, I need you
to keep your eyes open.

51:17.324 --> 51:18.575
Keep your eyes open.

51:19.701 --> 51:21.161
Let's talk about something.

51:23.955 --> 51:26.458
I remember you were a great rider.

51:28.126 --> 51:30.796
Won every event you were in,
every competition,

51:30.879 --> 51:32.589
you'd win everything.

51:33.965 --> 51:37.469
I remember you were
just about 11 years old.

51:37.552 --> 51:40.764
You won five events in one day.
That's really something.

51:41.598 --> 51:43.892
Gabrielle, stay with me.

51:43.975 --> 51:46.603
You can do it. We're gonna be home soon.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.022
I'll take care of you.

51:50.065 --> 51:52.484
You got so much life left.

51:52.567 --> 51:55.529
You got so many things you gotta do.

51:56.571 --> 51:57.864
So many things.

52:00.367 --> 52:04.371
When I came home a long time ago,
you were so young.

52:04.454 --> 52:05.872
Gabrielle, you were so young.

52:07.791 --> 52:10.669
I was lost. I was a lost man.

52:11.711 --> 52:14.005
And then I met you.

52:15.841 --> 52:20.262
And I saw something that I didn't think
I'd ever see anymore.

52:21.638 --> 52:25.642
Good in this world. Some innocence.

52:25.725 --> 52:30.105
And I had a family that
I never thought I'd ever have.

52:30.188 --> 52:34.234
And raising you, it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

52:34.317 --> 52:37.445
And I thank you for that. Thank you.

52:37.529 --> 52:38.780
You're like the--

52:40.407 --> 52:42.909
Gabrielle? Gabrielle.

52:49.791 --> 52:51.877
Gabrielle. No, no.

52:51.960 --> 52:53.253
Oh, don't do it.

52:55.297 --> 52:56.381
Gabrielle?

52:59.259 --> 53:00.635
Oh, God.
